Linlu Qiu
======
I'm an AI Resident at [Google Research](https://research.google), where I work with [Fei Sha](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~feisha) and [Pete Shaw](http://www.ptshaw.com). I graduated from Georgia Tech with a Master's in Computational Science and Engineering. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from the University of Hong Kong. I'm currently working on compositional generalization and grounded language understanding.
